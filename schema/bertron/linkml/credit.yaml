  CreditMetadata:
    description: |
      Represents the credit metadata associated with an object.

      In the following documentation, 'Resource' is used to refer to the object
      that the CM pertains to, for example, a KBase Workspace object or a
      sample from the KBase Sample Service.

      The 'resource_type' field should be filled using values from the DataCite
      resourceTypeGeneral field:

      https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-mandatory-properties#10a-resourcetypegeneral

      Currently KBase only supports credit metadata for objects of type
      'dataset'; anything else will return an error.

      The license may be supplied either as an URL pointing to licensing information for
      the resource, or using an SPDX license identifier from the list maintained at https://spdx.org/licenses/.

      Required fields are:
      - identifier
      - resource_type
      - versioning information: if the resource does not have an explicit version number,
      one or more dates should be supplied: ideally the date of resource publication and
      the last update (if applicable).
      - contributors (one or more required)
      - titles (one or more required)
      - meta

      The resource_type field is required, but as there is currently only a single valid
      value, 'dataset', it is automatically populated if no value is supplied.
